# Music Recommendation by emotion recognition

A basic application that detects and recognises emotion of user through camera feed and plays song recommendation from selected playlist based on the emotions. This project uses the FER2013 dataset, achieving an accuracy of 65.50% in classification into 7 mood classes through a 4-layered Convolutional Neural Network. A few attempts and plots of some attempts can be found in the repo.

86% accuracy in classifying songs into 4 mood categories, using Random Forest Classifier.

Current issues that need to be resolved: Better UI, autoplaying recommended songs, higher accuracy etc.

Does not include datasets used.
